Music Tracker
=============

The code in this repository implements a simple music tracker in TypeScript.

To see it in action, open the file Source/MusicTracker.html in a web browser that runs JavaScript.

To build, run the command "tsc" from within the Source directory.  Note that, since the transpiled JavaScript files are included in the repository, it should not be necessary to build before running.
